The Wernig Lab investigates the epigenetic and chromatin-based mechanisms that drive pediatric cancer, with a focus on the regulatory landscapes of neuroblastoma. Our research integrates molecular biology and translational data science to connect fundamental genomic discovery with the design and analysis of early-phase clinical trials.

## Our Research Focus

​We study how the misregulation of chromatin and distal regulatory elements shapes tumor identity and the microenvironment. 

​Our research investigates the interplay between:
- ​DNA Methylation and Hydroxymethylation: Mapping the modifications that govern gene silencing and activation.
- ​Chromatin Accessibility: Defining the landscape of open regulatory regions using ATAC-seq.
- ​Histone Modifications: Identifying the marks that establish and maintain oncogenic or pro-regression states.

## ​Bioinformatics and Clinical Data Science

​Our lab maintains a core emphasis on computational biology and biostatistics. We utilize bioinformatics to interpret complex datasets and bridge the gap between bench science and clinical applications.
- ​Single-cell Analysis: We employ scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq to resolve the heterogeneous cell populations and regulatory states within neuroblastoma.
​- Clinical Trial Design: We apply biostatistical expertise to the design of pediatric clinical trials. Our team performs secondary analyses of clinical trial data, primarily integrating these results with our own NGS datasets to evaluate biological markers and treatment efficacy.

## ​​Experimental Models and Clinical Translation

​We utilize human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and iPSC-derived organoids to model the tumor <-> microenvironment interactions. We are currently developing these organoid models as platforms to test therapeutic interventions in a setting that mimics the clinical environment.
