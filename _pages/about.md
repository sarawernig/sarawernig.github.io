As a dedicated postdoctoral researcher, my work is driven by a profound commitment to understanding the complex epigenetic mechanisms underlying pediatric cancer. With a robust background in experimental molecular biology, complemented by advanced training in next-generation sequencing and bioinformatic analysis, I am passionate about bridging the gap between experimental research and clinical applications.

During my doctoral studies and subsequent postdoctoral research, I have honed my skills in dissecting the nuances of gene regulation at the epigenetic level. My current research focuses on the tumor microenvironment and epigenetics of Neuroblastoma and novel innovative treatments. By leveraging single-cell RNA and ATAC sequencing technologies and sophisticated bioinformatic tools, I aim to uncover novel insights that could lead to more effective and less invasive treatment options for children suffering from cancer.

I actively collaborate with multidisciplinary teams of scientists, clinicians, bioinformaticians, statisticians, and experimental researchers, and am eager to engage with potential collaborators or institutions interested in making significant advances in pediatric oncology. My goal is to contribute to science that not only advances our understanding but also translates into tangible benefits for patient care.
