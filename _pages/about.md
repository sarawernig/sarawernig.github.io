​My research investigates the epigenetic and chromatin-based mechanisms that drive pediatric cancer, with a specific focus on the regulatory landscapes of neuroblastoma. I integrate molecular biology and translational data science to connect fundamental gene regulation with the design and analysis of early-phase clinical trials.

## ​Research Focus

​I study how the misregulation of chromatin and distal regulatory elements shapes tumor identity and the microenvironment. My research investigates the interplay between:
- ​DNA Methylation and Hydroxymethylation: Mapping the modifications that govern gene silencing and activation.
- ​Chromatin Accessibility: Defining the landscape of open regulatory regions using ATAC-seq.
- ​Histone Modifications: Identifying the marks that establish and maintain oncogenic or pro-regression states.

## ​Bioinformatics and Clinical Data Science

​A core focus of my work is computational biology and biostatistics. I utilize bioinformatics to interpret complex datasets and bridge the gap between bench science and clinical applications.
- Single-cell Analysis: I employ scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq to resolve the heterogeneous cell populations and regulatory states within neuroblastoma tumor cells and their interactions with the microenvironment.
- Clinical Trial Design: I apply biostatistical expertise to the design of pediatric clinical trials. Additionally using secondary analyses of clinical trial and integrating the results with my own NGS datasets to evaluate biological markers and treatment efficacy.

​## ​Experimental Models and Clinical Translation

​My team utilizes human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and iPSC-derived organoids to model tumor-microenvironment interactions. We are currently developing organoid models as a platform for pre-clinical testing of therapeutic interventions in a setting that mimics the clinical environment.

​## ​Mentorship and Supervision

​Beyond my research, I am committed to academic mentorship of young researchers. I currently co-supervise two PhD students, guiding their work in wet lab and dry lab, and helping them navigate the intersection of computational biology and experimental work.
